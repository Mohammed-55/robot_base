in this project, I made the robot base interface and combined it with the robot arm interface by using Html, CSS, javascript, and PHP programming languages. and the tasks that I must do:
1.      Making a robot base control interface by using HTML, CSS, and javascript.
2.      Making a database for the robot base.
3.      Connect the control panel with the database.
4.      Making a PHP page that can retrieve the information from the connected interface.
5.	Combining the control panel of the first task with this control panel
6.	Display the interface as a mobile web view. 


here I will write the user manual to show how to use this interface:

you can start it by using the robot_controller.php with the localhost(localhost/robot_controller.php).
after you start it you can see the base control panel at the bottom.
there are five buttons that you can choose which are forward, backward, left, right, or stop.
after you choose the direction that you want it will be saved in the database.
you can see the database information by using: localhost/base_info.php and it will show you the last direction you choose.
also, I wrote a meta code in the head of robot_controller.php so that it will allow the mobile web view.
